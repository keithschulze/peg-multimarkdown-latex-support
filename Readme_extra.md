In addition to the default multimarkdown metadata in [peg-multimarkdown], I've added a couple more in order to both simplify and allow more customisation for thesis type latex docs. These are `Doc Class` and `Doc Options` which allow you to specify the document type and options for the latex file (i.e.\documentclass[docoptions]{docclass}).
